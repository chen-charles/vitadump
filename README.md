# grabnids.py

Run it like this: `python3 grabnids.py /path/to/directory/with/stubs_a/ nids.txt`

Or you can make your own `nids.txt` using whatever tools you've got, for example of such file see `nids.txt.example`

# nidformat.py

Creates a `nids.txt` from a [`db.yml`](https://github.com/vitasdk/vita-headers/blob/master/db.yml) so that it can be used with `vitadump.py`.

Run it like this: `python3 nidformat.py /usr/local/vitasdk/share/db.yml nids.txt`

# vitadump.py

**Note:** Before using this script, you *need* to have a file named `nids.txt`. You can create it with [nidformat.py](#nidformatpy).

Just load your binary into IDA and run the script from IDA menu: `File -> Script file...`

Requires:

* IDAPython 7.4

It will:

* read imports and exports from the loaded binary file and create functions
* resolve NIDs and rename functions
* find strings and create xrefs to them
